## Description
My Portfolio website created using react. Contains list of skills and projects also a little about me.

## Tech-stack
- React
- JSX
- SASS

## Build Steps
To run locally
```bashs
npm run start
```
or 
to build app
```bashs
npm run build
```

## Design Goals / Approach
Tried to make it a bit interative with a carousel for skills and card select for projects.
Some elements of animation was included in the design.

## Future Goals
Landing section is a bit blank. Planning to add some artwork/animation later on.
